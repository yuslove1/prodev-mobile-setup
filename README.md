# Mobile Development with React Native (using Expo)

This repository contains a series of exercises and examples exploring the fundamentals of mobile development using React Native and Expo.  From setting up the development environment to implementing core components and handling safe areas, this project provides a hands-on learning experience in building cross-platform mobile applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the development environment and run the examples on your local machine and physical device using Expo.

1. **Install Node.js and npm (or yarn):**  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.  You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Expo CLI:** Install the Expo CLI globally using npm (or yarn):

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli

   ```

3.  **Navigate to the project directory** 

```bash

cd MyApp(the app folder name)

```

4. **Install Expo Go on your physical device:**
        - Android: Install Expo Go from the Google Play Store.
        - iOS: Install Expo Go from the Apple App Store.


5. **Start the development server:**

```bash

expo start

```
6. **Run the app on your physical device:**

        - A QR code will be displayed in the terminal and in the Expo Developer Tools web interface (which opens automatically in your browser).
        - Open the Expo Go app on your physical device.
        - Scan the QR code with your device's camera. The app will load and run on your device.
